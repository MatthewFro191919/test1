  "note": "DDE is not only one of the best fan mods I’ve ever seen for Dave and Bambi I’ve ever seen, but for fnf as a whole as well. The sheer amount of talent this team has is incredible, and it blows my mind every time I check up on it. It’s been a genuine honor to work alongside so many amazing people, everyone on this team is extraordinary in their own way; the way it all comes together really makes this mod shine in my opinion. \nThank you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to such an amazing project! I hope you all enjoyed : - D"
