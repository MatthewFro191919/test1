  "note": "howdy! im one of them Dee Dee Ee devs and im incredibly NORMAL about this game. it was very awesome and cool and such a privilege to get to work on it! so you better have enjoyed it, or else THE SKULL will get you! i was held in a subterranean prison of cold dead concrete and asphalt for 30 long, long years by he who is called \"STATICKED TIGERS\" as I poured my BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS into my contributions, such that I would not prematurely see or know about the final product of this COOL VIDEO GAMES until close to release for the Full Experience. I'm still down here. Waiting. Yearning. Longing to see the fruits of all our labor. The sun has not touched my bones in god knows how long. Maybe one day, I will be let free to live amongst the rest of humanity, if there is any humanity in me left. OK BYE ^_^",
