  "note": "I still cant believe that im just in this project, working on this was super fun and exciting and i still cant comprehend the fact that im Here. I can't believe that content that was teased for about 3 years is now releasing and im genuinely so happy for this team and how much got achieved in such little time recently. This mod is incredibly special to me and i love everything about it and its a mod that made me feel welcome and glad to be here. Its a project that everyone puts every bit of their passion on and add very amazing details to everything they can with a lot of effort. Its such an amazing project coming from very talented people and I hope everyone enjoys this mod as much as possible and look out for more updates :D Thank you so much for playing.",
